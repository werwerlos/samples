A test case, if written correctly, can be an amazing source of truth and knowledge. 

Although there is no one right way to write them, I think the ones of greatest value are those which can teach you about the system at the first run.  

Dear wanderer, in this folder you will find some examples showing the way I create them. Dare to write if you have a suggestion on how they should be improved to make them even more valuable. 


### Some information about the decisions made:
1. TCs were written using <code>html</code> to provide a pleasant and consistent visual aspect. 
2. All images are in the specified folder. 
3. TC attributes such as priority, feature etc. were intentionally omitted.
4. my goal is not to exhaustively describe all possible cases but only to give an example of what they may look like. Therefore, the selection of TCs is completely random.
5. Although written based on a real, existing site, all identifying elements have been removed.
